            <p>Throughout high school, I was involved in a few extracurriculars where I developed code outside of robotics. I developed several games in the unity engine in my schools Video Game Development club, as well as one for the Technology Student Organization, which
                was also where I participated in my first Cybersecurity Capture the Flag competition.

            <h4 class="standardHeader">Unity development</h4>
            <p>I've been developing video games using the Unity engine and the C# scripting language as personal projects since middle school. I've made a 2D platformer, a Galaga-style arcade
                game, and more recently a physics-based maze game with randomly generated maps. Alongside the Unity Engine I use Pixel art programs to create artwork and animations for the games. Unfortunately, this stuff has been a little
                lost to time because they were not linked into a github.

            trainings, color guard, and being able to lead the John T. Dempster division, have helped shape the person I am today. Click below to see the archived Sea Cadets page, which is no longer being worked on.
