            <p>Recently, I've joined my high school's Technology Student Association club. It's an organization that hosts a yearly contest in each state about a multitude of STEM concepts, from
            mechanical engineering to cybersecurity. During the 2019-2020 school year I aimed to participate in Board Game Design, Video Game Development, and Cybersecurity activities, but unfortunately
            only the Cybersecurity activity could be held virtually due to COVID-19</p>

            <h4 class="standardHeader">Video Game Development Club</h4>
            <p>I have a passion for video games in general, and developing them has been an undertaking of mine for a while. I'm a member of the school's Video Game Development Club, where students
            come together and group up to develop video games, primarily using the Unity Engine available on the school's computers.</p>

            <h4 class="standardHeader">Unity</h4>
            <p>Aside from the club, I've endeavored in developing video games using the Unity engine and the C# scripting language since middle school. I've made a 2D platformer, a Galaga-style arcade
            game, and more recently a physics-based maze game with randomly generated maps. Alongside the Unity Engine I use Pixel art programs to create artwork and animations for the games.</p>

            <h4 class="standardHeader">Computer Programming</h4>
            <p>I am very much a computer person, from my passion with video games to my understanding of software and programming. I first started to teach myself Java at the site Codeacademy.com,
            and gradually started to expand out to other things, from Unity's C# to HTML and CSS, and of course Java in Android Studio. A lot of my skills were self-taught before I started
            taking computer science classes in high school, and I continue to work and improve my ability to code.</p>

            <h4 class="standardHeader">Sea Cadets</h4>
            <p>Through my middle and high school years, I was involved in the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, a leadership development program. My experiences in the USNSCC, through various summer
            trainings, color guard, and being able to lead the John T. Dempster division, have helped shape the person I am today. Click below to see the archived Sea Cadets page, which is no longer being worked on.

            <p>Aside from coding and after-school clubs, my hobbies at home range from video games, to dungeons and dragons. My friends and I are fans of tabletop board games and RPGs, and more recently
                I've started to paint Warhammer 40,000 minis.<p>
