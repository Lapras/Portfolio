    <h1>Jeremy Murray</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Jeremy Murray, a student at Robbinsville High School. This website is my portfolio for FTC 14020 Nemesis Prime, I am trained in software, CAD, and machinery. This website is still in development.</p>

    <div>
        <p> Development on the site is picking up, while the CSS style reset seemed to cramp my style (nice pun eh?), I have also begun to structure my code with headers, articles, sections and whatnot. Come back later when this website starts to look better!</p>
