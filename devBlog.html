        <h3 class="blogTitle">AND NOW IT IS TIME TO HOST!!!!!!!!!<h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">5/23/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> So today, (which technically hasn't happened yet at time of writing), I've got the final stuff done and I'm ready to host the site. <br>
            I'm gonna use Freenom and Netlify for hosting and then the site should be up for everyone to see... yay? I implemented some webkit stuff for hidden scrollbars<br>
            when the standard divs get too high, so now it will look a bit better and still maintain functionality once you make the window less wide.

        <h4 class="blogDate">5/21/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> Well yesterday I couldn't do much but today I used Photoshop to clean up and add new silhouetted images for <br>
            the software page, which gave me... more trouble than I wanted. I also <br>have new content in for the CAD pages and replaced all those images I marked

        <h3 class="blogTitle"> DevRush2: Electric Boogaloo</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">5/19/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> OK yeah this got abandoned for a bit, but I'm back! After a bit of research I think for now I'm good with keeping the site as-is in terms of layout. <br>
            I want to focus on content instead of fancy scrolling images or something (especially considering I'm lacking good images). So far I've flagged placeholder images for replacement.. <br>
            And I'm waiting to receive the replacements from school sources. I've also gotta get photoshop on the computer again to edit the Silhouetted logos.
            TODO: <br>
            Retreive new images <br>
            Download photoshop <br>

        <h3 class="blogTitle"> Day 6 and 7 combined</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">4/14/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> Unfortunately I've been sick (not with coronavirus) over the last couple of days, so working on this was sub-optimal. I couldn't get the 4/14
            deadline extended for FTC so it's still missing some key features that I would like to have had, but the main content for the FTC page is done. Most of the images
            are moved over from wix and even the quotes as well, which I don't mind too much because I liked them. Other images are placeholders until I can get the silhouetting
            work done at a later date. Online school is also starting up again, so devlog updates will happen less often, but more stuff will likely be done. I'm gonna look into
            a way to have the user "scroll" sideways through projects i've done rather than just endlessly scroll down but i've got on idea how it's gonna work right now.<br>
            What I got Done: <br>
            FTC Robotics sections (main page and sub-pages) have been developed, but aren't done yet.<br>
            Projects-style organization method has been developed, giving site sub-pages some more variety
            TODO: <br>
            Refine content on the sub-pages, replace placeholder images<br>
            develop gallery code
            add new quotes
            begin development on page for sea cadets, and a page for personal projects.

        <h3 class="blogTitle"> Day 5</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">4/12/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> Well today sucked, I was sick so not too much ended up getting done. The main page for robotics is done though! just need the pictures
            and quotes. I played around with a drop-down system but I kind of gave up on it. Honestly I think I'm only going to get the FTC page done before 4/14<br>
            What I got Done: <br>
            FTC Robotics page added and nearly complete<br><br>
            TODO: <br>

        <h4 class="blogDate">4/1/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> Wow, that was a lot. Main page is finished, styling and layout is finalized and i've got images from the old Wix portfolio uploaded.
            This took a while but this was most likely my most productive day. And the Devblog got styled today! It used to be just kind of a wall of text but now it's
            stylized and organized a bit better. I looked up the CSS transition property and now the buttons grow and change background gradually when you hover over them!
            The Header also phades in and out now due to a script i added!<br>
            What I got Done: <br>
            Layouts finalized and colorization changed, content and images for main page is done, but this may be changed later.<br>
            added CSS transitions for button and header phade <br>
            added header phade script <br>
            TODO: <br>
            Work on sub-pages and more content<br>

        <h4 class="blogDate">4/10/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> HOLY CRAP I got stuff done, organization of main page is finalized and so is the majority of styling
            everything is pretty and in colors and the page adjust to viewport height and width well.<br>

            Standardized layout done, header done, styling done, coloring done, CSS Reset implemented <br>

        <h3  class="blogTitle">Day 1? Day 1.5? Day 2? idk</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">4/9/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> A lot of progress, flexbox made layout really easy and I got the index page organized, everything is still pretty fugly and i might
            revisit later today, but otherwise we got some good stuff done here<br>
        What Got Done: <br>
        implemented layout for index and some standardized layouts <br>
        TODO: <br>
        Get some of the basic styling and coloring done <br>
        Complete the full content for Index/home/aboutme page, start hosting, and begin work on sub-pages <br>
        Refine the organization so that a couple specifically spoopy things don't happen when you make the page too thin</p>

            about flexbox. New year, new portfolio. Devblog start's here and entries will likely be daily for a while. <br>
