        <h4>4/8/2020</h4>
        <p>Literally everything was deleted, only thing that is the same is the github repository. Working on a new computer and a new design with knowledge
        about flexbox. New year, new portfolio. Devblog start's here and entries will likely be daily for a while. <br>
        What Got Done: <br>
        Made layouts for home, content, gallery, and devblog page <br>
        TODO: <br>
        begin HTML development and content, Home page first
        Implement flexbox systems and develop website header</p>
