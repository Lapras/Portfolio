        <p> A lot of progress, flexbox made layout really easy and I got the index page organized, everything is still pretty fugly and i might

        implemented layout for index and some standardized layouts <br>
        TODO: <br>
        Get some of the basic styling and coloring done <br>
        Complete the full content for Index/home/aboutme page, start hosting, and begin work on sub-pages <br>
        Refine the organization so that a couple specifically spoopy things don't happen when you make the page too thin</p>
