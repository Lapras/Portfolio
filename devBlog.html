        <p class = "blogText"> Wow, that was a lot. Main page is finished, styling and layout is finalized and i've got images from the old Wix portfolio uploaded.
            This took a while but this was most likely my most productive day. And the Devblog got styled today! It used to be just kind of a wall of text but now it's
            stylized and organized a bit better. I looked up the CSS transition property and now the buttons grow and change background gradually when you hover over them!
            The Header also phades in and out now due to a script i added!<br>
            What I got Done: <br>
            Layouts finalized and colorization changed, content and images for main page is done, but this may be changed later.<br>
            added CSS transitions for button and header phade <br>
            added header phade script <br>
            TODO: <br>
            Work on sub-pages and more content<br>
