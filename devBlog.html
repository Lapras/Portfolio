    <h3>Looking OK and the about me page</h3>
    <h4>2/14/19-2/19/19</h4>
    <p>Thanks to some handy resources from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, I've vastly
        increased my basic knowledge.
        I've used floats to create a simple two column layout for my home page, as well as used CSS to create a gradient
        background, some buttons, and some
        neat borders. It still doesn't look like much but it looks a lot better than it used to. I've also added the
        about me page, which is going to
        include some simple info about me (obviously).</p>

    <h3>Initial Development</h3>
    <h4>2/14/19</h4>
    <p>Page was first created along with the establishment of the domain. Code has been semi-organized and a basic
        background color was picked.</p>
