        <h3 class="blogTitle">Update and curation</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">2/12/2023</h4>
        <p class = "blogText">Alright, so portfolio is getting an update in preparation for the thing. (If you're reading this, you know who you are, and hello! A lot has gone on since the last update so I had to add a lot of new
            sections for the different stuff I've been up to. Coding projects, Cyber stuff, and some touchups, and a resume update. The colors are still terrible but I still don't have any ideas for it. And the pictures are probably
            going to be jank for all  <br>
            PATCH: 2/12/23: Alright, so Netlify (hosting service) hasn't updated the build image for a while and it was deprecated, so that's been updated so the website can update, and I fixed a typo. <br>
            PATCH 2/14/23: Change of plans, ACC is being done this year and im gonna hopefully build a rocket (sounds super fun), I also fixed a typo. This also probably means that ACC, Cyber stuff, etc. will go into a seperate sub-page for A&M later when I have more content. <br>
            PATCH 2/15/23: I forgot to change the year to 23 in the patchs aaaaaaaand there was a typo in my resume :[ . Probably just screwed myself over royally there. Either way it's fixed ON the site after this patch. <br>
            PATCH 4/10/23: Well Freenom went down, so I can't renew my domain name, and that's what I've been using for the domain name. I've changed the tx.ag shortcut to Netlify's default domain name as a temporary fix until I either find a freenom alternative
            or it comes back up

        <h3 class="blogTitle">Summer Revisit</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">8/8/2022</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> WOHOOOOOOOOO I got the ETAM. I am now officially a Compsci student. I did a couple wording changes, a typo change, and the personal button should no longer lead
            to sea cadets. I also added a resume download buttn in the nav tab. No color scheme changes, my head is empty when it comes to that stuff honestly.

    <article class="blog">
        <h3 class="blogTitle">Finishing Up</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">5/2/2022</h4>
        <p class = "blogText">Well, it's been a while. Kinda procrastinated but it's okay, everythings done. Robotics is updated. Sea cadets is moved. A&M is finalized. I honestly don't have enough for seperate pages so it's all on one page.
            If you're reading this, you're probably evaluating my ETAM application. Honeslty, I'd just look at the github and see what I've done with the code. I still have to un-jank the images but I don't have the best photo editing software on hand.
            And yes, the colors are terrible, but I can't think of anything better still. <br>
            Update pages, probably create a seperate Corps/NROTC page when I have more content <br>
            new color scheme? Maroon didn't work out but this shouldn't stay. <br>
            PATCH: 5/6/2022: I had to re-do the captions for the video gallery is I got the order wrong, and the auton displayed for 21-22 was NOT final.
        </p>

    <article class="blog">
        <h3 class="blogTitle">Guess who's back? Back again.</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">4/7/2022</h4>
        <p class = "blogText">Well, it's been a while, and I'm in college now. But I'm hosting again, and theres going to be some major content additions for the site. More 20-21 Robotics media,
            updates to the Robotics page, and likely a removal of the Sea Cadets page as it's integrated into the Personal section. I'm a freshman at A&M now, so I'll probably be updating the pages
            look slightly with a maroon color (it's a good color scheme and I've been informed the red is harsh). And I'll be adding a section about the Corps of Cadets, with a section about the college itself
            in the personal section (or maybe just one setion about A&M and a subpage about the corps I haven't decided.)
            But if you notice, the header has changed a bit! In a refresher on my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills I've added a drop-down menu for robotics! Which I'll probably start implementing more. That's
            been what most of my development time has been spent on so far (it was honestly quite interesing to reverse-engineer the tutorial video and apply it to the flexbox structure.) But content updates will be soon.
            aside from the fancy drop-downs. The most noticable change is in hosting. I'm still using netlify, but freenom is still updating the nameservers as I write this, and so I've decided to begin using the new
            tx.ag/ link shortener that A&M provides, which is a wonderful way to clean up links I can put in my resume, although I hope in the future I can still link the shortener to the original jeremymurray.tk domain name.

        <p class = "blogText"> Well after uninstalling webstorm because I had to wipe my SSD a little bit back, I've got access back to edit the site and I made a few edits
            I'm a senior now as well as fixing the button in the USNSCC section. Not much I'm going to update now except for FTC stuff. But it's all going well!

        <h4 class="blogDate">7/22/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> Personal page is done! This contains more miscellaneous activities like my hobbies and after-school clubs! I fixed a few things with the site, and I think at this point
            I'm mostly done with the site. I want to focus more of my energy on college applications now, and if I do update the site it will be later in the future, and I'll likely make a large graphical
            improvement, making everything look a little less janky. I have to say I happy with the way the site is for now, but I'm definetely going to be eager to imporve it when the time comes.

        <h4 class="blogDate">7/21/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> Well, either Webstorm or Github has stopped working because I cannot push, my caveman brain decided to try and creat ea whole new repository
            and I accidentally copied over the OLD website files, rather than the new ones. Luckily Github allows you to recover deleted repositories, and so I had to re-do
            the media gallery, but NOW it should be OK. i just need to figure out why I can't push to github. The good news is, I got the Sea Cadets page done. I did away with the color-scheme
            change I had in mind because I think it's be wierd if the whole scheme changed to accomodate it's theme, I also have to check and make sure the list of trainings I've attended is
            accurate. Tomorrow, I'm going to work on a page for personal projects I pursue at home and my hobbies, as well as miscellaneous clubs. After that, I'm going to focus all my
            energy on the USNA and USAFA admissions processes. But I'm really happy with how the site is!<br>

            when the standard divs get too high, so now it will look a bit better and still maintain functionality once you make the window less wide.

        <p class = "blogText"> OK yeah this got abandoned for a bit, but I'm back! After a bit of research I think for now I'm good with keeping the site as-is in terms of layout. <br>
            I want to focus on content instead of fancy scrolling images or something (especially considering I'm lacking good images). So far I've flagged placeholder images for replacement.. <br>
            And I'm waiting to receive the replacements from school sources. I've also gotta get photoshop on the computer again to edit the Silhouetted logos.

        <h3 class="blogTitle"> Day 6 and 7 combined</h3>
        <h4 class="blogDate">4/14/2020</h4>
        <p class = "blogText"> Unfortunately I've been sick (not with coronavirus) over the last couple of days, so working on this was sub-optimal. I couldn't get the 4/14
            deadline extended for FTC so it's still missing some key features that I would like to have had, but the main content for the FTC page is done. Most of the images
            are moved over from wix and even the quotes as well, which I don't mind too much because I liked them. Other images are placeholders until I can get the silhouetting
            work done at a later date. Online school is also starting up again, so devlog updates will happen less often, but more stuff will likely be done. I'm gonna look into
            a way to have the user "scroll" sideways through projects i've done rather than just endlessly scroll down but i've got on idea how it's gonna work right now.<br>
            What I got Done: <br>
            FTC Robotics sections (main page and sub-pages) have been developed, but aren't done yet.<br>
            Projects-style organization method has been developed, giving site sub-pages some more variety
            TODO: <br>
            Refine content on the sub-pages, replace placeholder images<br>

            stylized and organized a bit better. I looked up the CSS transition property and now the buttons grow and change background gradually when you hover over them!
