        <h4 id="aboutTitle">CAD and Machinery</h4>
        <p><br>The team has made extensive use of Autodesk Inventor and Computer Aided Design (CAD). Which is used to better visualize hardware or create entirely custom parts through the machines in the school techlab. Scroll down
            for more information on what I've done with CAD over my years in FTC, and the machines used to create the custom parts.</p>

            We've used this to cut custom aluminum bars for our drivetrain as well as a prototype elevator system during the 2018-2019 season.</p>

            <p>When the 2020 FIRST season was canceled, FIRST worked with ONSHAPE to create a challenge where students would CAD robots that could solve a world problem.
            I teamed up with several students from NEMESIS Prime, and CADed together a robot to submit for the competion. The attached picture is
            of one of the sides of the drive train that I designed for the competition.</p>

            <p>NEMESIS Prime strives to spread our knowledge of STEM skills to others, as such, two other members and I have planned and taught two different lessons on CAD
            software. The first one was hosted at our high school, where we taught students of VEX robotics teams from the area about Autodesk Inventor. For the second, we went
            to Cinnaminson High School and taught students there about ONSHAPE, a free, browser and cloud-based software.</p>

            completely custom designed and 3D printed. Parts to adapt to GOBILDA U-Channels, the main assembly, and other addons went through multiple iterations
            before finally being implemented.</p>
