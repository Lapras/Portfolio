            <p>The Corps of Cadets Cyber Operations Special Unit (COSU), taught me a lot during my Sophomore year, and since then I have earned the title of first sergeant for the unit, helping them plan and carry out lessons for old and new members, as well as preparing the unit for competions like the NCX.
                It has been an incredible experience to grow my ability to understand cybersecurity and teach it to others.

            <p>To help hone my cybersecurity skills, I've particiated in numerous Capture the Flag (CTF) cybersecurity competitions. Of these, the most notable include the NSA Codebreakers 2022 and 2023 competions, and the NSA NCX 2023 competition.
                I've taken what I've learned from these compettions and applied them to this site. There's a flag hidden here somewhere (first clue on this page). See if you can find it, it's not super hard.
