        <p><br>My experience on the software team, and eventually lead programmer at 14020 has been some of the most challenging programming work I've had. Using Java and an SDK provided by FIRST Tech Challenge. I've programmed
            driver controlled and autonomous programs for three seperate years of robot competitions. From incorporating open-source plugins to working with machine learning software. Scroll down to see a display
            of the major projects I've worked on for the team's software.</p>

            <p class="projectText">FTC Teams are granted access to Google's Tensorflow machine learning software, as well as software generated by FTC to help team's use
            webcams to detect specific objects on the field. The team has made heavy use of this over the 2018-2021 seasons for autonomous tasks. A major portion of the autonomous routine is processing
                and utilizing the data from tensorflow. From getting basic positional data to calculating specific distances and angles on the fly when combined with other data from the webcam.</p>

            <h3 class="projectTitle">Driver Operated Control</h3>
            <p class="projectText">A large portion of the game is operated by driver's. As such, constant communication with the driver's about a desired control scheme and how to
            implement it is essential to help the driver's on the field. Over the years I've helped develop several assists for driver control, such as mappoing analog inputs on parabolic or cubic curves, as well
            as a field-centric drive for the 2019-2021 season's holonomic drivetrains, which use the onboard gyro to switch the driver's inputs to be relative to the rotation of the field rather than that of the robot.</p>

            <h3 class="projectTitle">Autonomous Navigation</h3>
            <p class="projectText">Nemsis Prime uses several navigational tools within the Robot's hardware in order to ensure smooth and precise navigation across the field. From using simple
                motor encoders and a gyroscope in the 2018-2019 season. To the utilization of dedicated odometry wheels and PID control systems within the software during the 2019-2021 seasons. Autonomous
                navigation is key to scoring the crucial first points within a matches autonomous period.</p>

            <h3 class="projectTitle">FTC Roadrunner: PID, Motion Profiling, Trajectories</h3>
            <p class="projectText">In the 2019-2020 season as well as the following 2020-2021 season, I personally took on the implementation of FTC Roadrunner, a gradle plugin provided by another FTC team that allows
            for complex path following. Roadrunner can create profiles for proportional, integral, and derivative control, motion profiles on a singular axis as well as complex paths
            for a robot to follow. Implementing this into our code allows us to take full advantage of our holonomic drivetrain during the autonomous period, as well
            as minimize error during the autonomous period. Implementation of roadrunner into our autonomous has been a major leap in FTC's autonomous capabilities.</p>

            <p class="projectText">The team has established a git repository for each year, and for the 2019-2020 season two individual repositories for each robot. Github
            helps keep us organized as well as keep track of a "final" version of the code that we can view for competitions. View the team's Github organization

            <p class="projectText"> The team uses Android Studio to develop code in Java. FTC provides teams with a standard SDK of the code used to interact
            with the robot's hardware, this only contains examples for how to program and teams must develop and expand from there.</p>

            <p class="projectText">FTC Dashboard is a gradle plugin built by another FTC team that allows us to see telemetry data from the robot on a computer. We can then
            graph this information or save it for later. This helps greatly with PID tuning and analysis of any issues the robot is having, both physical or within the software.</p>
