        <h4 id="aboutTitle">Competitions</h4>
        <p><br>The hard work of FTC culminates in competitions, where teams cooperate and compete to advance to state, and even worlds competitions.
        Each year the game changes to present new challenges to the teams. Each member of the team is helping in some way during the competitions and it can become
        very hectic. Scroll down to visit the major parts of a competition.</p>

            <h4 class="standardHeader">The Pits</h4>
            <p>Each team is given a pit area where they are allowed to make hardware and software changes to the robot, last minute adjustments,
            strategy discussions, and software changes are always being made. This area is most busy when the team isn't actually competing, but when
            something goes awry, someone is in the pits waiting to fix it.</p>

            <p>In order to be prepared for alliance selection, members of the team conduct scouting during the competition. Observing the strengths and weaknesses
            of other teams, and seeing which ones would best pair with our robot if we were to move on to the alliance selection stage. This data is
            cumulated into a spreadsheet for later use.</p>

            <p>Before the competition even begins, all teams get a period to present what they've done during the season to the judges. From outreach opportunities
            to teaching others STEM to our Robot's design. This is an extremely important part of the competition as this presentation is a large basis for gaining
            awards.</p>

            <h4 class="standardHeader">The Game</h4>
            <p>Most annual FTC games are divided into three main periods. A 30 second autonomous period where robot's operate using only sensors and without external
            guidance. A 1 minute 30 second driver controlled period, where drivers control the robot's using approved gamepads, as well as a 30 second engame, which
            is a continuation of the driver controlled period, and contains extra objectives for teams to accomplish. This year's game is Skystone, focusing on
            stacking interlocking blocks in a tower.</p>
